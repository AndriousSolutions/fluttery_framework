## _What's Your Preference?_

Preserving your preferences is such a common feature found in apps, the ‘Shared Preferences’ 
capability is now ingrained in the Fluttery Framework. An array of static functions are defined in the library, *Prefs*.
Being static, they are available to you throughout your app. You just have to call it.
